title: "Install demo: docs-only admissibility (drop-in posture)"

owner:
  team: "demo"
  approver: "human:@maintainer_handle"

intent:
  goal: "Demonstrate a drop-in admissibility gate that allows only docs changes."
  scope:
    includes:
      - "docs edits"
    excludes:
      - "engine changes"
      - "workflow changes"
      - "secrets"
      - "execution code"

assumptions:
  - "This contract demonstrates the strict install posture for a target repository."
  - "Any change outside docs/ is out-of-scope."

constraints:
  bounded_authority:
    can_write_paths:
      - "docs/"
      - "artifacts/"
    cannot_touch:
      - ".github/workflows/"
      - "adl/"
      - "integrations/"
      - "secrets/"
      - "trading/"

alternatives_rejected:
  - option: "Allow workflows in install demo"
    rejected_because: "Would defeat bounded authority; install posture should be strict."

success_criteria:
  - "CI admits docs-only changes"
  - "CI blocks if workflows or engine paths are touched"
