# v0.2 – Steward Visibility

v0.2 introduces visibility primitives for Decision Stewardship.
The goal is not prediction. The goal is **early detection of boundary stress**.

## 1) Boundary Pressure Report

### What it is
A derived report that shows where the system repeatedly approaches governance boundaries.

### Inputs
- changed paths over time
- bounded authority constraints
- near-miss patterns (changes that repeatedly appear adjacent to forbidden areas)
- repeated scope edits in contracts

### Outputs
- top pressured paths/domains (ranked)
- scope expansion velocity (per decision_id)
- “pressure hotspots” across the repo surface

### Why it matters
Most governance failures begin as “small, reasonable exceptions” that accumulate.
Boundary pressure makes that accumulation visible early.

### ML usage (optional, constrained)
- clustering boundary-adjacent change patterns
- anomaly detection on scope expansion velocity

ML is advisory; enforcement remains deterministic.

## 2) Decision Debt Thresholds

### What it is
A measurable debt signal derived from aging decisions and unvalidated assumptions.

### Debt signals (examples)
- decisions older than N days without reaffirmation
- success criteria never observed or never evaluated
- assumptions contradicted by new evidence references

### Outputs
- decision debt score per domain
- debt trendline over time
- threshold-triggered review suggestions

### ML usage (optional)
- survival analysis / hazard scoring for “time-to-invalidated”
- prioritization ranking for review queue

## 3) External Evidence References (No Adapters)

### What it is
A standardized way to reference external evidence without creating runtime coupling.

### Examples
- incident IDs
- KPI dashboards URLs
- risk register IDs
- cost guardrails references

### Principle
The control plane validates structure and falsifiability, not business logic.
This keeps governance portable and audit-grade without integration sprawl.
