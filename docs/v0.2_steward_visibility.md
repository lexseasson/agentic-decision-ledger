# v0.2 – Steward Visibility

v0.2 adds “visibility muscle” for the Decision Steward.  
The goal is not more bureaucracy — the goal is **fewer ambiguous approvals** and **faster review** under bounded authority.

## Deliverables

## 1) Boundary Pressure Report
A deterministic report generated from decision runs:

- most common out-of-bounds paths attempted
- repeated forbidden touches (by path class)
- which contracts are missing authority (under-specified can_write_paths)
- which contracts are overly permissive (suspiciously broad authority)

**Output target:**
- `artifacts/reports/boundary_pressure.json`
- `artifacts/reports/boundary_pressure.md`

## 2) Decision Debt Thresholds
Introduce a minimal scoring model:

- debt signals: missing alternatives, weak success criteria, missing revocation, repeated warnings
- thresholds: WARN at X, FAIL at Y (configurable)

**Output target:**
- `artifacts/reports/decision_debt.json`
- surfaced in Decision Record

## 3) External Evidence References (no adapters)
Contracts may reference external evidence sources without runtime coupling:

- incident IDs (e.g., INC-1234)
- metric links (string references)
- risk register IDs

The gate validates:
- structure exists
- references are present
- success criteria are falsifiable

It does not fetch or integrate with external systems (by design).

## Why this matters
v0.2 turns the control plane from “pass/fail gate” into a **stewardship surface**:
- it highlights where teams are pushing boundaries
- it makes risk visible before incidents
- it reduces review latency by standardizing admissibility artifacts
